# SQL Query Generator

## Overview

This project serves as an SQL Query Generator comprising two main steps: SQL specification generation and query generation from specification. It contains modules dedicated to different components of SQL queries, including GROUP BY, HAVING, WHERE, JOIN, LIMIT, ORDER BY, limit, among others.

## Project Structure

### Folders:

- [group_by_having](./group_by_having): Contains modules for generating GROUP BY clauses.
- [having](./having): Modules for generating HAVING clauses.
- [helper_funcs](./helper_funcs): Utility functions used across the project.
- [join](./join): Manages JOIN connections.
- [limit](./limit): Generates LIMIT clauses.
- [order_by](./order_by): Generates ORDER BY clauses.
- [output](./output): Stores generated output files.
- [read_schema](./read_schema): Reads schema details from files or databases.
- [select_query](./select_query): Generates SELECT clauses.
- [table_expression](./table_expression): Creates table expressions.
- [where](./where): Generates WHERE clauses.

### Files:

- [config_file.json](./config_file.json): Configuration file for the project.
- [query_generator_from_specifications.py](./query_generator_from_specifications.py): Generates queries from specified criteria.
- [specification_generator_using_ht.py](./specification_generator_using_ht.py): Generates specifications using hash table.
- [README.md](./README.md): This file.
- [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt): Lists project dependencies.

### Other Files:

- [output/farm.json](./output/farm.json): Sample JSON specifications generated by the project.
- [output/res.csv](./output/res.csv): Sample CSV queries based on a specification generated by the project.

## Usage

The project focuses on generating SQL queries based on various specifications. It provides modularity with separate modules for different SQL query components, enabling easy extension and modification.

## Getting Started

1. **Change configurations based on your desire in [config_file.json](./config_file.json)**: 
   Configure settings as required within the `config_file.json` to align with your project requirements.

2. **Generate Specifications**: Run the following command to generate specifications from the configuration file.
   ```bash
   cd query_generation
   python3 specification_generator_using_ht.py
3. **Generate Queries from Specifications**: Run the following command to generate queries using the created specifications:
    ```bash
    cd query_generation
    python3 query_generator_from_specifications.py
    ```

## Folder Structure

The `output` folder is referenced for storing project-generated output files.
